## Description

## Solving
Given a website that seems like a file-sharing utility.

![e73d30b1969f58f091cd60a4b5c1adaf.png](/assets/images/d3b7f581a152465aa199d59eb2457018.png)

Judging by the web interface, the goal of this challenge is supposed to open the Flag folder. But if we tried to click on that folder, the web asks for an email address and a MagicHash.


![2a8923dabb74671eb19d533dd129e577.png](/assets/images/2cf3a228e10a479a906edf385f8ce5fe.png)

Notice that there's also a link to request the MagicHash. Upon clicking the link, we were redirected to `http://192.81.210.234:10003/request.php`. 

![7f56ae1c54279544f21992a86ad66f11.png](/assets/images/ec27feda947346b59193ae0ce49fb464.png)


We need to submit an email address to get the MagicHash. Submitting a random or unrecognized email will make the server responded with an error message, but that also gave us hint about the correct email; **admin@tornado.corp**.


![7e9d8dafd69d7382da5c513e2c09e6de.png](/assets/images/28a1f43d176f4f1b8717ff3f717319cd.png)

After sending the request with **admin@tornado.corp** email, the web told us that the MagicHash has been sent to the email.


![78f0310f976c7c4d8a0f55d28deedf4d.png](/assets/images/0976a9562f024704b3c1a09390629773.png)

Since we don't have access to that email, we need to think of other ways to get the MagicHash. More information can be found by examining the leaked source code of the website.

The challenge provided us three source code files: `functions.php`, `include.php`, and `requests.php`.


![9763d12dadb18e84d0e8e36bf7319257.png](/assets/images/98db4a5f4f434f408b8fa0ecf0384a5c.png)


Below is a detailed examination of what we can find from each file.

### Request.php
This file is the source code of the page where we request a MagicHash. From there, we know that there is no email being sent at all. The input was sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` function, so it's unlikely that this challenge is about SQL Injection.


![6fe376bd06b58222f9e75d12589139cc.png](/assets/images/eb436f8f29ab40bd879f460838e9212f.png)

Also, a function named `generateMagicHashToken()` is called. And if the supplied email can be found in the database, both the email and the generated token will be stored in a table named `magic_hashes`.


![67a3337c53799eac13d859f4fb1c5446.png](/assets/images/c10cb5a45bd349318c143b35823ac659.png)


### Functions.php
This file contains some functions that are used to run the website. There are four functions:

1. `throwSeed()`
    In the leaked source code, this function is redacted. We can guess that this function is supposed to generate some value for the random's seed.
    ```
    function throwSeed() {
        // REDACTED. This is some sophisticated algorithm.
    }
    ```
2. `generateMagicHashToken()`
    This function calls `mt_rand()` function, which is used to generate random value via the Mersenne Twister Random Number Generator, five times. After that, this function will construct a string token out of those five random values, separated by `-` token, and finally generates a SHA1 string with value from another `mt_rand()` call. 
    ```
    function generateMagicHashToken() {
        for($i=0; $i < 5; $i++) {
            $token[$i] = mt_rand();
        }
        $token = base64_encode(implode("-", $token) . "-" . sha1(mt_rand()));
        return $token;
    }
    ```
    Simply put, this is the structure of the generated token:
    ```
    mt_rand() + "-" + mt_rand() + "-" + mt_rand() + "-" + mt_rand() + "-" + mt_rand() + "-" + sha1(mt_rand())
    ```
3. `createSession()`
    Judging by the name, this function is used to generate a token for a session or cookie. The website uses a cookie called `secure-session`, with base64-encoded string as the value.
    

    ![95d5de0520d319679cd73fa18e70de62.png](/assets/images/ea120af7fbc249a799d8f6d0066786d2.png)
    
    The decoded value of the cookie would be something like this:
    ```
    0dc397a9409687ba6e70f4dfe9f334a9fdbc81f7102912384.757827708d738b098366f3731261a9d6fbea3eb68a3f749ec
    ```
    
    And this is the structure of the generated token:
    ```
    sha1(<implode of 13 mt_rand() values>) + mt_rand() + "." + mt_rand() + sha1(<implode of 226 mt_rand() values>)
    ```
    
    So from the decoded value of the cookie, we would know that:
    
    1. The 14th `mt_rand()` call will generate `102912384`, since this number appears after 40-characters long of SHA1 string and right before the dot (`.`)
    2. The 227th `mt_rand()` call will generate `757827708`, since this value appears right after the dot (`.`) and before the 40-characters long of SHA1 string.

4. `displayMessage()`
    This is a helper function that prints error or success messages. This has nothing to do with the challenge, only for aesthetic reasons.

### Include.php
This file confirms our guesses about some functions in `functions.php`. `throwSeed()` is used to supply a seed value to `mt_srand()` value. And `secure-session` cookie's value is coming from `createSession()` function.


![de77bbe27ae843e2bb6034dfc919083d.png](/assets/images/4d32e9b185674db38643753146e0b1f5.png)

This challenge is based on [this](https://www.ambionics.io/blog/php-mt-rand-prediction) research from Ambionics Security. The goal is to predict the seed that was supplied to `mt_srand()` in `include.php` file, to generate the MagicHash token of our own. It's a good thing to read and even understand how the attack work; but for the sake of simplicity, I will summarize it. 

Here are the steps:

1. Obtain a value generated by a `mt_rand()` call, let's say it's value *x*.
2. Obtain another value generated by the 227th `mt_rand()` call after the *x*. Let's say it's value *y*.
3. Get the scrambled state from these values.
4. XOR those states and deduce the initial state 228.
5. Get the seed by working back from `s228` to `s0`, which are  

If you are confused, the crystal clear explanation can be found on the link when I refer to the research above, or [here](https://www.ambionics.io/blog/php-mt-rand-prediction). They also provide the POC script of the attack that you can use. To use the script, we simply need two `mt_rand()` values (the *x* and *y*), and also we need to know how many times the `mt_rand()` has been called before we get the *x* value. The answer is 14; because the only visible `mt_rand()` result that we have is the 14th and the 227th (unless you can completely break SHA1).

And for that we implemented a Python script to get the cookie from the website, extract the *x* and *y* values, and guess the seed from the two values (adapted from Charles Fol (@cfreal_)'s art of work):

After we get the seed, we can recreate the MagicHash of our own. We just need to re-run everything that the web does, given the fact that we have some of the source code. Here's the PHP script to do that, adapted from the given source code:

```
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

mt_srand((int)$argv[1]); # get seed from argv

function createSession() {
    for($i=0; $i < 13; $i++) $key[$i] = mt_rand();
    $salt = mt_rand(); # 1st printed value
    for($i=0; $i < 226; $i++) $backup[$i] = mt_rand();
    $backup_salt = mt_rand(); #2nd printed value
    $token = base64_encode(sha1(implode("", $key)) . $salt . "." . $backup_salt . sha1(implode("", $backup)));
    return $token;
}

function generateMagicHashToken() {
    for($i=0; $i < 5; $i++) $token[$i] = mt_rand();
    $token = base64_encode(implode("-", $token) . "-" . sha1(mt_rand()));
    return $token;
}
createSession(); # emulate calling mt_rand() to create session.
$token = generateMagicHashToken();
echo $token;
```

Just remember that the `createSession()` function is always called first before the web generates the MagicHash token (calling `generateMagicHashToken()`). If you don't call the `createSession()` before generating the MagicHash, the token might be invalid since you'll lack 242 `mt_rand()` calls before generating the token.

Here's my MagicHash token guessed by the PHP script:

After that, if you haven't, request a MagicHash from the web.

And use the guessed MagicHash to unlock the Flag directory.

And there's the flag.

But, once again, the value in the **comment** column is a base64-encoded string. Decode it and you shall get the flag.
