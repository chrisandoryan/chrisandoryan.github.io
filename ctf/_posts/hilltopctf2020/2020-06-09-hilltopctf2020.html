		Hilltop CTF 2020 is an online Capture The Flag competition organized by <a href="https://securityblue.team/">Security Blue Team</a>. This year, I had the chance to be part of the Content Engineers team. We had fun developing and testing each other's challenges, keeping eyes on the servers, and even had some chances to talk and discuss with the participants. As for myself, I developed five web exploitation challenges from the basic to intermediate difficulty; and here it is, the intended solution for the challenges.
